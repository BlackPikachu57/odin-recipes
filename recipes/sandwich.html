    <h3>Grilled Cheese Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            This classic grilled cheese sandwich recipe calls for just white bread, sliced cheese, and butter. 
            It's easy to switch up the bread and cheese to suit your taste preferences and, if you like, you can substitute mayonnaise for butter.

    <h3>Best Cheese for Grilled Cheese</h3>
        <p>
            This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar,
            mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese 
            â€“ it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.

            Other delicious options are Gruyere, Brie, Fontina, Gouda, Pepper Jack, and havarti.

    <h3>Best Bread for Grilled Cheese</h3>
        <p>
            This recipe calls for plain white sandwich bread. You could also use sourdough, brioche, or even ciabatta.
            You can really make grilled cheese with any type of bread you like, but you should make sure the loaf is 
            sturdy enough to handle the heat. Thinly sliced, delicate breads will quickly fall apart.
